# Machine Learning Models Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Models Repository**! This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models for different tasks, including **regression**, **classification**, and more. The models in this repository aim to provide a solid foundation for understanding machine learning techniques and their applications.

---

## 🚀 Features

This repository includes a wide range of machine learning models, including:

- **Linear Regression**: For predicting continuous values based on linear relationships.
- **Polynomial Regression**: A more advanced form of regression to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification tasks.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: For classification problems with high-dimensional data.
- **Decision Trees**: For both classification and regression tasks.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method based on decision trees.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm for classification and regression.
- **Naive Bayes**: For classification tasks based on probabilistic reasoning.
- **K-Means Clustering**: For unsupervised learning and clustering tasks.

All models are implemented using **Python** and libraries like **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib**.
